Hi! I am Vijay Alagappan. I am an engineer and I love designing and making stuff! My favourite hobby is learning and I like to learn anything and everything under and above the sky - science, math, arts, technology, business, music and human languages. But, my special focus areas for learning are mechanical, electrical and computer science engineering and think of myself as a full stack robotics engineer. Currently, I am employed as a CAE Analyst responsible for crash simulations at Mercedes Benz R&D India Pvt. Ltd. In my free time, I enjoy reading, working out and building stuff!
