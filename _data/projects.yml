# Self-Driving Cars course projects
- project: Programming a real self-driving car: Capstone Project
  role: Student, Team Lead
  duration: October 2019 &mdash; Present
  url: "https://github.com/vjmechwiz/CarND-Capstone"
  description: This was the final Capstone project involving modules on perception, planning and control plus integration using Robot Operating System. I was the Team Lead for this project and I used this opportunity to learn planning and execution of a self-driving car software project at a small scale. It was also the first time I collaborated with other engineers on GitHub.
